                <p className="sm:pl-8 sm:pr-8">Utility Stores Corporation was established in July 1971, by taking over 20 retail outlets from the Staff Welfare Organization. Passing through various stages of expansion and reorganization, the 4000 + Stores Corporation at present is operating 4000+ stores throughout the Country. We are committed to providing clean, graded, hygienically fit, unadulterated genuine food and non-food items to the public and especially to the poorer segments of the society, at comparatively cheaper rates than the market and to offer them a pleasant environment of mutual confidence while making their purchases.</p>
